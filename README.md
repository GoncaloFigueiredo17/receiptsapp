## Project Title

The main goal of this project is to help users find meal ideas based on the ingredients they currently have available. This idea came to me because I really enjoy cooking, but often struggle to come up with recipes when my ingredients are limited.

## Acknowledgements

 - Learn react and node.js, and understand how to connect the backend with frontend
 - Solve daily problems
 - Improve code organization and best practices
 


## API Reference

#### Receive all the meals, based on just one ingredient (not the main objective)
